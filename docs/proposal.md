## Summary
Galaga is a fixed shooter game where the user controls a starfighter, attacking and dodging enemies from above.

In this project, we will use and evaluate reinforcement learning agents capable of playing Galaga autonomously.  By using reinforcement learning algorithms, the agent will learn to move, shoot, and defend itself from the enemy in the game environment.
